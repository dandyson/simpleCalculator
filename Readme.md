# Calculator

## Steps:

1. Grab all the number buttons using forEach and add event listeners to each.

2. Grab all the operator buttons using forEach and add event listeners to each.

3. Add an equals and clear all button and add event listeners.

4. When a number or operator button is clicked, get the inner text of that button and display it in the display at the top.

5. When the user presses equals, check what math operator was used, split the 2 numbers either side into separate variables and calculate the result based on which operator was used.
